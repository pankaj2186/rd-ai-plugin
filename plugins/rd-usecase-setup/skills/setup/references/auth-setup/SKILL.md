# Authentication Setup

AEM and Adobe Target operations mostly go through their installed MCP connectors, which manage their own OAuth. The one exception is the dedicated `export_content_fragment_to_target` tool (see `aem-content`), which makes its own direct HTTP call to AEM and therefore needs its own bearer token — `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN`. This skill loads or collects `AEM_HOST`, `TARGET_ORG`, and `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` in `.env`, gets explicit user confirmation, and only then proceeds — every later step in the flow reuses these confirmed values rather than re-asking.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never invent credentials** — always prompt for or confirm real values; never fabricate a placeholder and treat it as real
2. **Confirm before proceeding** — whether `.env` values are freshly entered or already present, the user must explicitly confirm them before anything else runs
3. **Reuse, don't re-ask** — once confirmed, `AEM_HOST`/`TARGET_ORG`/`AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` are used for every subsequent call in the session; don't re-derive or re-prompt later
4. **Verify by calling a real tool** — "authorized" means a real MCP call succeeds, not just that the connector is listed
5. **Mask `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` in all output** — it's a real credential, unlike `AEM_HOST`/`TARGET_ORG`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load or collect `.env` values

Check `.env` for `AEM_HOST`, `TARGET_ORG`, and `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN`.

- **Not present / empty:** prompt the user for each value **one at a time** — `AEM_HOST` (the AEM author environment URL), then `TARGET_ORG` (the Target org/tenant identifier), then `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` (a bearer token from a technical/service account, scoped to content-fragment export — see `aem-content`'s export section for why this one needs its own token) — and write them to `.env`.
- **Already present:** show the user the current values (mask `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN`) and ask them to confirm they're still correct. If the user provides a correction, update `.env`.

**Do not proceed to Step 2 until the user has explicitly confirmed** — either by supplying fresh values or confirming the existing ones.

### Step 2: Verify the AEM MCP connector

Call `list-aem-environments` (no params). If it errors or returns nothing usable, tell the user: *the "Adobe Experience Manager" connector needs to be authorized via claude.ai connector settings (or `/mcp` in an interactive session)* — don't ask them for tokens directly. If it succeeds, check whether the confirmed `AEM_HOST` actually appears among the discovered environments — if not, tell the user about the mismatch and ask them to reconcile it (correct `.env`, or confirm that environment genuinely isn't reachable via this connector).

### Step 3: Confirm the AEM environment is awake (not hibernated)

AEM Cloud Service dev/stage tiers auto-hibernate after inactivity — appearing in `list-aem-environments` doesn't mean the instance is actually reachable right now. There's no dedicated hibernation-status tool, so probe it: run a lightweight `read-api` call against the confirmed `AEM_HOST`. If it fails or times out in a way that looks like the instance is asleep rather than a normal error, **stop and tell the user**: *the AEM environment may be hibernated — open it in a browser to wake it (can take a few minutes), then ask me to retry.* Don't retry silently in a loop.

### Step 4: Verify the Adobe Target MCP connector

Call a lightweight Target tool such as `list_target_mboxes` or `list_target_activities`. If it errors, tell the user: *the "Adobe Target MCP" connector needs to be authorized via claude.ai connector settings* — again, no token prompts. `TARGET_ORG` is reported for reference in Step 6 — none of the Target MCP tools take it as a call parameter, since the connector's own OAuth session is already scoped to an org.

### Step 5: For AEM + Target personalization journeys — confirm integration prerequisites up front

Before generating or executing any plan for a personalization journey (content-fragment-backed page/block personalization), **ask the user directly** — there's no API to check either of these:
1. **AEM↔Target IMS integration is already configured**, and
2. **The EDS repo's `/scripts/at-lsig.js` is already the at.js library** from Target > Administration > Implementation.

Both are one-time, manual, admin-console/repo steps outside this skill's reach. If either isn't confirmed, **stop the whole journey here** — don't let it surface three steps later inside `aem-content`'s fragment-creation workflow.

### Step 6: Report status

| Check | Status | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `.env` values confirmed | ✅/❌ | `AEM_HOST` / `TARGET_ORG` / `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` as confirmed in Step 1 |
| AEM MCP connector authorized | ✅/❌ | Result of `list-aem-environments`, incl. any `AEM_HOST` mismatch |
| AEM environment awake | ✅/❌ | Result of the `read-api` probe |
| Target MCP connector authorized | ✅/❌ | Result of the lightweight list call |
| AEM↔Target IMS integration confirmed (personalization journeys only) | ✅/❌ | User confirmation |
| EDS at.js confirmed (personalization journeys only) | ✅/❌ | User confirmation |

## Notes

- This session cannot run an OAuth flow itself — if a connector isn't authorized, the fix happens outside this skill (claude.ai connector settings, or `claude mcp` / `/mcp` interactively). Don't ask the user for auth codes, tokens, or callback URLs — that flow is separate from `.env` and doesn't apply to `AEM_HOST`/`TARGET_ORG`.
- `AEM_HOST` and `TARGET_ORG` are non-secret targeting values, confirmed once per session in Step 1 and reused as-is (`AEM_HOST` as the `aemUrl` argument to every `list-aem-environments`/`lookup-api-spec`/`read-api`/`write-api` call).
- `AEM_EXPORT_TOKEN` **is** a real credential — the one exception to "no tokens in this plugin." It exists solely because `export_content_fragment_to_target` (hosted by `export-cf-to-target`, see `aem-content`) makes its own direct HTTP call to AEM and can't reuse the AEM MCP connector's OAuth session. Scope it to a technical/service account with only the access that endpoint needs, not a personal admin token.
